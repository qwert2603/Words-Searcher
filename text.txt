VK (originally VKontakte, Russian: literally "in touch") is the largest Russian social networking service in Europe.[4] It is available in several languages, but particularly popular among Russian-speaking users around the world, especially in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. Like other social networks, VK allows users to message contacts publicly or privately, create groups, public pages and events, share and tag images, audio and video, and play browser-based games.[5]

As of November 2014, VK had at least 280 million accounts.[6] VK is ranked 22 (as of November 1, 2014)[7] in Alexa's global Top 500 sites and is the second most visited website in Russia, after Yandex.[8] According to eBizMBA Rank, it is 8th most popular social networking site in the world.[9] As of January 2014 VK had an average of 65 million daily users.[10]

In 2013, Mirilashvili family sold his 40% share in the company, receiving $1.12 billion for it from United Capital Partners,[11] while Lev Leviev sold his 8% share in the same deal, giving United Capital Partners 48% ownership. In January 2014, VK's founder Pavel Durov sold his 12% stake in the company to the CEO of Megafon, which is controlled by Alisher Usmanov. Following the deal, Usmanov and his allies controlled around 52% of the company.[12] Shortly thereafter, the CEO of Megafon, sold his 12% stake to Mail.ru, thus allowing mail.ru to consolidate their controlling stake of 52% in VK.[13]

On September 16, 2014, the Mail.ru group bought the remaining 48% stake of VK from Blesmir Development and Palagon, thus becoming the sole proprietor of the social network.[14]
VKontakte was incorporated on 19 January 2007 as a Russian limited liability company. Founder and CEO Pavel Durov owned 20% of shares (although he had majority voting power through proxy votes), and a trio of Russian investors, Vyacheslav Mirilashvili ( Mikhael Mirilashvili's son) and Lev Leviev (not from Africa-Israel Investments),[15] owned 60%, 10% and 10% respectively.[16] The original founders then sold a stake of 39.99% to Mail.ru Group (formerly Digital Sky Technologies).[17][18]

On 29 May 2012 Mail.ru Group announced that it has decided to kimi yield control of the company to Durov by offering him the voting rights on its shares. Combined with Durov's personal 12% stake, this gave him 52% of the votes.[19][20] In April 2013, United Capital Partners bought 48% of VK shares from Vyacheslav Mirilashvili and Lev Leviev for $1.12 billion.[21] In 2014 Pavel Durov sold his 12% stake to Ivan Tavrin, the CEO of Russian mobile phone operator Megafon.[22]

In April 2014 Durov stated he had sold his stake in the company after "coming under increasing pressure" from the Russian Federal Security Service to hand over personal details of users who were members of a VK group dedicated to the Euromaidan protest movement.[23]

VK canceled their IPO plans, citing unsatisfactory market conditions after Facebook's IPO blunder.[20][24]

Gaining in popularity from their success from "Blackout", Scorpions performed to over 375,000 fans on Day 2 at the three-day US Festival concert held in San Bernardino, California during Memorial Day Weekend of 1983. The concert was aired live on MTV, giving the band wide exposure in a live show.

It was not until 1984 and the release of Love at First Sting that the band finally cemented their status as the internationally popular band they are now known as. Propelled by the single "Rock You Like a Hurricane", Love at First Sting climbed the charts and went double platinum in the USA a few months after its release.

MTV gave the album's videos "Rock You Like a Hurricane", "Bad Boys Running Wild", "Big City Nights", and the power ballad "Still Loving You" significant airtime greatly contributing to the album's success. The channel even supplied Scorpions with the nickname "The Ambassadors of Rock" to the chagrin of industry insiders who recognized the executive influence behind the scenes. The Rolling Stone magazine named them "The Heroes of Heavy Metal".

The band toured extensively behind Love at First Sting and decided to record and release their second live album, World Wide Live in 1985. Recorded over a year-long world tour and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at No. 14 in the charts in the US and at No. 18 in the UK.

After their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record Savage Amusement. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, Savage Amusement represented a more polished and mature sound similar to the style Def Leppard had found success with. The album sold well but was considered somewhat of a critical disappointment. However, British heavy rock magazine Kerrang! did award the album five K's out of five.

On the Savage Amusement tour in 1988, Scorpions became only the second Western group (not American) to play in the Soviet Union. Uriah Heep had performed in December, 1987 in Leningrad. The following year the band returned to perform at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. As a result, Scorpions developed an extended Russian fan base and still return to perform.[17]
